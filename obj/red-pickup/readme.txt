NOTES
-----
The doors and bonnet does not have detail on the inside of the parts. 

The model is NOT perfect, parts of the shell, doors and bonnet suffer from backfacing polys which can cause bodyparts not to display in the poser scene window but does render correctly. This issue does not occour in other applications.  

This model is being provided as a gift to the poser community. Please respect the spirit in which it is given.
