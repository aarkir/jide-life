#Inspiration
Losing memory isn't fun for anyone. In the United State, Alzhemier's diease is very common. Statistics shows that there are more than 3 million cases per year, and we still have no idea how to cure this disease. However, research shows that exposing patients to photos from the past and the most famous songs of their age can spark their memory and help retrieve some of their failing memory. We are trying to employ new technology to help people suffering memory loss to retrieve back their memory.

#What it does
jide.life is an VR showcase app for people to immurse in the past memory and help improve the memory of the user. jide.life retrieve data from the user's facebook, spotify, and past news data form the past memories of a user. When the app starts running, it will display user's photo in the front, play user's favorate music of his/her age on the left, and show some pieces of past news headlines on the right. User can click on each of them to switch to content. Sitting inside such a environment, the user will experience the flashback of memory and able to recall things from the edge of memory.

#How we built it
We employed the brand new WebVR framework as the platform of our app, and used three.js to make awesome 3D modeling in the app. By using moblie technology, we can easily make our app compatiable to most of the VR devices including Oculus Rift, Samsung Gear VR, Google Cardboard, and etc. For the API call, we entirely abandoned server-size of the app, making all the API call running on the client side by Ajax. This practice minimized the cost of the application and gave users more flexibilities.


#Challenges we ran into
Both of us don't have any prior expreience with VR programming or javascript 3D modeling, so the project is whole new to us. We need to learn things in a very short time and use them to design the product. It can be expected that we are facing a lot of challenges in the procedure. For example, since the WebVR is a very new member in the VR technology, we can't find much totorials and examples on the internet. We had trouble linking the Oculus Rift to the WebVR. We fixed the problem by a number of trials. Also, since we don't have a pair of specially designed controller for Oculus Rift, we can't find any good ways to interact with the VR device, so we come up with the idea to use remote mouse to achieve the interactions.

#Accomplishments that we're proud of
We successfully made a well developed app with in a small amount of time with a large range of application and influence. The emotional and social benefits of the app are beyond people's imagination.

#What we learned
We learned how to use three.js and WebVR to make really fantastic 3D model and
